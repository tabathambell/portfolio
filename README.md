# Tabatha Bell Portfolio

## Description
This is the portfolio for the Module 2 assignment. In this project, I crafted the beginnings of my own portfolio to display what I have already learned. This included the basics of html, CSS, and the advanced CSS such as animations, media queries, flexbox, and CSS grids. Alongside of that, I learned different things from other sources such as W3Schools and professional guidance. These things include using "first-of-type" in order to put CSS on certain areas of the website as well as how to make an image circular and to do a shake animation. The image for the Run Buddy was cropped my me and the link to the github for the display is linked to it. The other images for the Coming Soon were cropped and colored by me in preparation for future projects.

The media queries were fit for both a tablet and for a phone. This was the most challenging part of the assignment, due to having to figure out what needed to be queried under these perameters and what was good to be in the flexbox when the window shrank. I ended up getting it with some assistance and demo-ing from a partner. The next biggest challenge was figuring out how to position the text over the hero image and make it look good. After a few trial runs and figuring out what was best for flexbox as well as the media query, I managed to get it to work beautifully.
